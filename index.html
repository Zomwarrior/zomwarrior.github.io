                <h3>Divide and Conquer Video Game - July 2025</h3>
                <p><strong>Networking & Server Setup:</strong> Collaborated with a team of 4 programmers to develop a multiplayer game, focusing on the networking aspect. Utilized <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>sockets</strong> to set up a server for remote connections, enabling seamless gameplay through port forwarding.</p>
                <p><strong>Game Development & Mechanics:</strong> Worked alongside another developer on the backend and networking, while other team members focused on implementing the core game mechanics. The game is a 4-player scribbling and drawing game where players must fill squares at least 50% before they auto-fill with their assigned color. Unfilled squares revert to white if under 50% completion.</p>
                <p><strong>Lobby & Chat Functionality:</strong> Developed a lobby screen that allows players to join, leave, and chat before starting the game. The lobby ensures that players can "ready up" before the game begins, providing a smooth transition from pre-game to active gameplay.</p>
                <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Used <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Pygame</strong> for both the game development and networking portions of the project, ensuring smooth multiplayer functionality and game experience.</p>

            <div class="project-card">
                <h3>Computer Graphics Panorama Generator - Feb 2025</h3>
                <p><strong>Panorama Generation:</strong> Developed a MATLAB-based program to automatically generate panoramic images from multiple input images. The system used keypoints and image stitching techniques to align and merge images into a seamless panorama.</p>
                <p><strong>Keypoint Detection & Feature Matching:</strong> Utilized SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) for keypoint detection and feature extraction across images. The system applied RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) for robust homography estimation and feature matching between overlapping image pairs.</p>
                <p><strong>Stitching Process:</strong> Implemented both horizontal and vertical image stitching, aligning multiple images from different sets. The program handled issues like image warping, blending, and feathering to ensure a smooth transition between the stitched images.</p>
                <p><strong>Automation & Output:</strong> The tool automated the entire panorama generation process, handling multiple image sets, processing keypoints, computing transformations, and stitching images together. It saved the final panoramic images in a specified output path.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> The project was implemented in <strong>MATLAB</strong>, using advanced image processing techniques like SURF, RANSAC, and homography transformations. The project utilized custom functions to handle image stitching, blending, and keypoint extraction efficiently.</p>
